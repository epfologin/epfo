The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is a statutory body under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India, and is one of the largest social security organizations globally.

Its primary role is to administer compulsory contributory schemes that provide provident fund, pension, and insurance to the workforce in the organized sector in India.

The EPFO administers three main schemes under the Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952:

Employees' Provident Funds (EPF) Scheme, 1952: A retirement savings scheme where both the employer and employee contribute a fixed percentage of the employee's basic salary and dearness allowance. The accumulated amount, along with interest, is generally payable upon retirement or resignation.

Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995: Provides monthly pension benefits for superannuation/retirement, disability, and also survivor benefits (to widow/widower and children) upon the death of the member.

Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) Scheme, 1976: Provides insurance benefits to the nominee or legal heirs of a member in case of the member's death while in service.

Functions and Governance
The EPFO is responsible for managing and enforcing the EPF & MP Act, 1952. Its key functions include:

Enforcement of the Act across the country (except Jammu and Kashmir).

Collection and investment of funds contributed by employers and employees.

Maintenance of individual member accounts.
